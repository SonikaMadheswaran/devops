# 📖 Introduction

This repository represents a structured and hands-on DevOps implementation journey.  
It demonstrates how modern development and operations practices work together to build, package, deploy, and automate applications efficiently.

The project focuses on practical execution rather than theory. Every module includes commands, configurations, deployments, and screenshots to reflect real-world implementation.

The goal is to understand how multiple DevOps tools integrate to form a seamless automation pipeline.

---

# 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

The primary objectives of this project are:

- To gain practical exposure to industry-standard DevOps tools  
- To understand the lifecycle of application deployment  
- To containerize applications using Docker  
- To deploy frontend applications using NGINX  
- To automate build and deployment pipelines using Jenkins  
- To manage infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code principles  
- To improve Linux command-line proficiency  

This repository acts as a consolidated DevOps practice environment.

# 🔄 Complete DevOps Workflow Demonstrated

This repository walks through the entire DevOps lifecycle:

1️⃣ Develop or download a sample application  
2️⃣ Track changes using Git & push to GitHub  
3️⃣ Build a Docker image for the application  
4️⃣ Run the application inside a container  
5️⃣ Serve production build using NGINX  
6️⃣ Manage container lifecycle (start, stop, remove)  
7️⃣ Install and configure Jenkins  
8️⃣ Prepare the foundation for CI/CD automation  

This provides a practical understanding of how modern deployment pipelines function.

---

# 🐳 Containerization Approach

The project demonstrates:

- Creating custom Docker images  
- Tagging images with versions  
- Running containers with port mapping  
- Using volume mapping for static file deployment  
- Understanding detached mode execution  
- Managing running containers  
- Cleaning unused resources  

This ensures clarity in container lifecycle management.

---

# 🌐 Web Deployment Strategy

The frontend application is:

- Built using Node.js / React  
- Compiled into production-ready files  
- Deployed into an NGINX container  
- Served via port mapping  

This reflects how production web apps are deployed using lightweight web servers.

---

# 🔁 Automation with Jenkins

The repository also includes:

- Installing Java dependencies  
- Adding Jenkins repository securely  
- Installing Jenkins service  
- Managing Jenkins using systemctl  
- Accessing Jenkins via browser  
- Understanding CI/CD pipeline basics  

This establishes the foundation for automation workflows.
