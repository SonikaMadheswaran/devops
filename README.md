**🚀 DevOps Learning Project**

📌 Overview

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey in DevOps and Cloud Technologies.
Instead of only studying theory, I practiced each tool by running commands, building images, creating containers, setting up CI/CD pipelines, and deploying applications to the cloud.

The project is structured step-by-step, starting from Linux fundamentals and moving towards containerization, automation, CI/CD, and cloud infrastructure.

🐧 1. Linux Basics

I started this project by strengthening my Linux fundamentals, since Linux is the backbone of most DevOps systems.

What I practiced:

File & directory management (ls, cd, mkdir, rm, cp, mv)

File permissions (chmod, chown)

Process management (ps, top, kill)

Package management (apt, yum)

Shell scripting basics

Working with logs and configuration files

Why this matters:

Linux is the primary OS used in servers, containers, and cloud environments. Understanding Linux commands helps in:

Debugging servers

Managing deployments

Automating tasks

Working with Docker, Jenkins, and cloud VMs

🐳 2. Docker (Containerization)

After Linux, I moved to Docker to learn how applications can be packaged and run consistently across environments.

What I practiced:

Writing Dockerfile for a Node/NGINX application

Building Docker images

Running containers

Exposing ports and mapping volumes

Managing images and containers (docker ps, docker images, docker rm, docker rmi)

Understanding container vs image concept

Why this matters:

Docker helps in:

Solving “it works on my machine” problems

Making deployments faster and more reliable

Running the same app in development, testing, and production

Simplifying CI/CD pipelines

🔧 3. Jenkins (CI/CD Automation)

Next, I worked with Jenkins to understand Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment.

What I practiced:

Installing and setting up Jenkins

Creating Jenkins jobs / pipelines

Connecting Jenkins with GitHub repository

Automating:

Code build

Docker image build

Basic deployment steps

Understanding build triggers and job execution

Why this matters:

Jenkins helps in:

Automating repetitive tasks

Running builds automatically when code changes

Reducing manual errors

Creating a real-world CI/CD workflow

☁️ 4. AWS (Cloud Platform)

Then I moved to the cloud using AWS to understand how real applications are hosted.

What I practiced:

Creating an AWS account

Launching EC2 instances

Connecting to EC2 using SSH

Installing required software on servers

Deploying applications on cloud servers

Understanding basic services like:

EC2 (Virtual Machines)

Security Groups

Key Pairs

Why this matters:

AWS is widely used in industry for:

Hosting applications

Scaling systems

Running production workloads

Managing infrastructure in a reliable way

🏗️ 5. Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)

After learning manual setup in AWS, I moved to Terraform to automate infrastructure creation.

What I practiced:

Writing Terraform configuration files

Creating AWS resources using code

Initializing Terraform (terraform init)

Planning changes (terraform plan)

Applying infrastructure (terraform apply)

Destroying resources (terraform destroy)

Why this matters:

Terraform helps in:

Creating infrastructure using code instead of manual clicks

Version-controlling infrastructure

Reproducing the same setup anytime

Reducing human mistakes in cloud setup

⚙️ 6. Ansible (Configuration Management & Automation)

Finally, I learned Ansible to automate server configuration and application setup.

What I practiced:

Writing Ansible inventory files

Creating playbooks

Automating:

Software installation

Server configuration

Application setup

Running playbooks on remote servers using SSH

Why this matters:

Ansible helps in:

Automating server setup

Managing multiple servers easily

Keeping configurations consistent

Saving time and avoiding manual configuration errors

🔄 Overall Workflow

Use Linux to manage servers and environments

Use Docker to containerize applications

Use Jenkins to automate build and deployment

Use AWS to host applications in the cloud

Use Terraform to create infrastructure using code

Use Ansible to configure and manage servers automatically

🎯 What I Learned

How real-world DevOps workflows work

How to move from manual setup to full automation

How different tools in DevOps connect with each other

How to deploy and manage applications in a cloud environment

The importance of automation, consistency, and reproducibility

🙌 Conclusion

This project represents my hands-on DevOps learning journey.
Each tool here is not just studied, but practiced with real commands, configurations, and setups.
The goal is to become confident in building, deploying, and managing applications using modern DevOps tools.
